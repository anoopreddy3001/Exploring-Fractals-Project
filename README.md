**Exploring Fractals**
1) **Pythagoras Tree Fractal:**
   - Description: The Pythagoras Tree, a fractal made of squares, expands recursively by appending two smaller squares to each square's right edge, forming a right triangle.
   - Usage: Begin with a single square and iteratively add two smaller squares to its right edge. Repeat this process for each new square created.
   - Features: Experiment with different recursion levels, angles, and scaling factors to create diverse variations of the fractal.

2) **Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems):**
   - Description: L-Systems model complex structures' growth through simple rules, generating strings of symbols iteratively, which can be interpreted to create intricate patterns.
   - Usage: Start with an initial string of symbols, then iteratively apply production rules to generate new strings. Interpret these strings to visualize fractal shapes.
   - Features: Explore fractal patterns by adjusting production rules and initial configurations. Control the number of iterations for varying levels of detail.

3) **Iterated Function System (IFS):**
   - Description: IFS constructs fractals by applying a set of affine transformations iteratively to an initial geometric shape.
   - Usage: Define affine transformations represented by linear functions and translations, applying them iteratively to generate complex fractal patterns.
   - Features: Customize affine transformations, experiment with different sets to create diverse fractal designs, and control parameters like scaling and rotation.

4) **Complex Numbers:**
   - Description: Complex numbers, expressed as a + bi, involve real and imaginary components, useful for exploring arithmetic operations and geometric interpretations.
   - Usage: Perform arithmetic operations, visualize on the complex plane, and understand geometric interpretations of complex number operations.
   - Features: Explore addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation operations with complex numbers.

5) **Wireframe Rendering:**
   - Description: Wireframe rendering represents 3D objects as lines and curves, useful for visualizing geometric shapes and fractals' structures.
   - Usage: Generate wireframe models of fractals and geometric shapes, controlling parameters like line thickness, color, and perspective.
   - Features: Render wireframe models, adjusting parameters for visual exploration from different viewpoints.
